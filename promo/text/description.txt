Toad On Fire is a fast-paced action-adventure shooter, with some RPG and puzzle elements sprinkled in. You play as Smokey, a toad armed with a flamethrower, and take the offensive against an invading force of hostile frogs.

Progress through 25+ levels of varying types, ranging from pure action to puzzle-based to boss battles. The flamethrower is your primary weapon, which can be utilized in many ways, for both attack and movement -- dispatch enemies with volleys of fireballs, or charge up a burst-shot that rockets you forward as a blazing toad-missile of death! Collect loot to purchase upgrades.

Whimsical tone. Anthropomorphic characters. Saucy antagonist. Lots of destruction, explosions, power-ups and secret areas. Boss battles. Controller support.
